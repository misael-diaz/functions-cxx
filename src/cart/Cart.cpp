// DEVNOTES:
//
// The problem statement should have defined the following asymmetric ranges:
//
// [0, WEIGHT_LIGHT),
// [WEIGHT_LIGHT, WEIGHT_BASIC),
// [WEIGHT_BASIC, WEIGHT_HEAVY), (THIS ONE IS MISSING FROM THE PROBLEM STATEMENT)
// [WEIGHT_HEAVY, INFINITY)
//
// This program accounts for the missing logic in its own way since it has been
// left to the programmer to decide and that is expressed in the code itself.
//
// There's also the issue of the charges by weight differences see notes below:
//
// The extra charge by weight difference must be defined with respect to the lower
// bound for each case so the problem statement is missing (again) program logic so
// we have added our own parameters to account for the missing data.
